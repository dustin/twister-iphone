# Twister for iPhone

This was going to be an iPhone port of my [twister][1] app, but I can't
actually try it on my phone without paying money, and I just don't want to do
that right now.

It works just fine in the simulator, although I didn't put any effort into the
graphics portion (just calling out positions in audio).
